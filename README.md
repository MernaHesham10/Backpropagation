# Backpropagation
Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate a gradient that is needed in the calculation of the weights to be used in the network
The goal of the backpropagation training algorithm is to modify the weights of a neural network in order to minimize the error of the network outputs

### Description
Implement the Back-Propagation learning algorithm on a multi-layer neural networks, which can be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.

Use the penguins data in both your training and testing processes. (Each class has 50 samples: train NN with the first 30 non-repeated samples, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)

2. After training


• Test the classifier with the remaining 20 samples of each selected classes and find confusion matrix and compute overall accuracy.
